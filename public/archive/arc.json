Judicious approach to music will facilitate better memorization and recall. This is the first part of the Tripartite Memory. Secondly, series of familiar settings with spatio-visual properties will be used to store information. The physical sizes these settings represent are not crucial, but their familiarity and clarity are. Finally, the third part concerns the storage of information. Images, dynamic or static, are the optimal choice. They should be related to the information either syntactically or conceptually. If you are artistically-minded, capitalize on your ability. If your ability is visual, use a sketching book to further enhance your application of the Tripartite Memory through application and as a means of alternative storage.\nTo sum up, Tripartite Memory combines visual, auditory, and spatial senses to create a highly effective means of storing information. As with most mental tools, constant practice will allow you to achieve this system's ultimate potential. Since this is a memory construct, practice will come hand-in-hand with daily use. A lack of practice, however, will slowly but surely erode your ability.\n","labels":["memory","mental","tools"]},{"index":5,"date":"08/28/2018","subjects":["Interesting","Developments"],"title":"SciTech News","subtitle":"You are what you eat.","author":"hcm","body":"Scientists identify a new kind of human brain cell\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180827180809.htm\n\"Roseship\" neurons, thought to be involved in fine-control between the regions of the brain, do not exist in animals.

Today it makes up a tenth. But the output of factories is still measured much more closely than that of services. Manufacturing output is broken down into 24 separate industries in the national accounts; services, which now make up 80% of the economy, are subdivided into only just over twice that number of categories.\"\n\nGDP measures many things obliquely and badly. For example, the sex-worker market in Britain is measured essentially by multiplying the price of a lap dance, the male population, and a fraction. An additional example is measuring banks' income. Since it is mainly not through fees, GDP has to use the spread between a risk-free interest rate and a lending rate, then multiply this by the stock of loans. However, this rewards banks' risk-taking, so financial crises often see banks' share prices have a countercyclical relationship with % total of GDP financial services are measured as.\n\n\"A further complication is that, for all the caution that statisticians offer against seeing GDP as a measure of welfare, the two are intertwined in perhaps the trickiest part of their calculations: adjusting for inflation. Inflation is a measure of how much more you have to pay this year than you did last year to achieve the same level of well-being. It is at least as challenging to measure as output.\"\n\nIn addition, it's hard to estimate for substitution following inflation. Geometric-mean aggregation is used to account for it. The weights of each category of goods are changed for broader shifts.\n\nChanges in quality were not measured well, resulting in ~.6% overestimation of inflation. To fix this, \"hedonic\" estimation is used to determine the price of each popular feature of a product. However, this is labor-intensive.\n\n\"...A further complication is that, for all the caution that statisticians offer against seeing GDP as a measure of welfare, the two are intertwined in perhaps the trickiest part of their calculations: adjusting for inflation. Inflation is a measure of how much more you have to pay this year than you did last year to achieve the same level of well-being. It is at least as challenging to measure as output.\"\n\n\"The benefits of many new products are simply not picked up at all. The upfront costs of providing services on a digital platform, such as Facebook or Twitter, are hefty. But the marginal cost is close to zero, and the explicit price to users is normally nothing. By global convention, zero-priced goods are excluded from GDP. So are all voluntary forms of digital production, such as Wikipedia and open-source computer programs. Some of this unpaid-for activity can be picked up in the accounting; although there is no charge for a Google search, consumers pay a shadow price by supplying information and attention, for which advertisers pay. But the advertising revenue is likely to be well below the benefits that consumers get.\"\n\nPhysical products, middlemen, and brick-and-mortar shops are being replaced by their online alternatives and user effort. These, however, do not count in GDP.\n\n\"The challenge, said Mr Nordhaus in his paper on light, is to construct measures that “account for the vast changes in the quality and range of goods and services that we consume.”\"\n\nAt times of great change, such as the industrial revolution or the current year, it's very hard to measure economic activity accurately using GDP. Most of that difficulty stems from the enormity of the task, but also from outdated assumptions and bases of measurements.\n \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSince late 2015, growth in real GDP has consistently exceeded that in real GDI, a prominent alternative measure of aggregate output, with an average difference of about 0.65 percentage point. Is real GDP overstating the expansion?\n\n\"Some have argued that, because the GDP and GDI series contain independent information, it may be preferable to combine the two series into a single more informative activity indicator. One series that uses such a combination is the Philadelphia Fed’s GDPplus series, which is a weighted average of GDP and GDI, with the weights based on the approach described by Aruoba et al. (2016).\"\n\n\"To examine how well each of the measures of aggregate output are able to forecast the CFNAI, we estimate the model using the sample observations up to the end of 2015, the period before GDP and GDI diverged. Once we determine the estimated coefficients that describe each relationship, we use those values to estimate forecasts for the period when discrepancies developed, from the first quarter of 2016 to the end of 2017. We then calculate the prediction errors, measured by the root mean-squared errors, for each measure of aggregate output. The smaller the prediction error, the better the forecasting performance.\"\n\n\"The figure shows that the prediction errors over this period based on the GDP series are substantively lower than those based on GDI or GDPplus.\"\n\n\"While GDP and GDI are theoretically identical measures of economic output, they can differ significantly in practice over some periods. The differences between the two series have been particularly pronounced in the past two years, when GDP growth has been consistently stronger than GDI growth. Based on this observation, some analysts have claimed that GDP might be overstating the pace of growth and that GDI, or some combination of GDP and GDI, should be used to evaluate the levels and growth rate of economic activity.\"\n\n\"We find that GDP consistently outperforms both GDI and combinations of the two, such as GDPplus, in forecasting aggregate economic activity during the past two years. In this sense, GDP is a more accurate predictor of aggregate economic activity than GDI over this period. Therefore, the relative weakness of GDI growth observed in recent years does not necessarily indicate weakness in overall economic growth.\"\n\n","labels":["finance","daily","reading","GDP"]},{"index":7,"date":"09/01/2018","subjects":["test_subject"],"title":"LabelSplitter Testing","subtitle":"It's 23 C outside","author":"hcm","body":"","labels":["label2","different_label"]},{"index":8,"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Edit MONGOOSE testing","subtitle":"0101 \"123\" 'xyz'","author":"hcm","body":"Test subject for \\n edit mode.\n\nindex should be 8.","labels":["testing","edit_mode"]},{"index":9,"date":"09/02/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Edit mode testing","subtitle":"0101 \"123\" 'xyz'","author":"hcm","body":"Test subject for \\n edit mode.\n\nAt edit:\nSeems good enough so far.","labels":["testing","edit_mode"]},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"MongoDB test 1","subtitle":"Canada mongoose","author":"hcm","body":"woah, dude.","labels":["test"],"index":10,"_id":"5b95646ba784a405380a2fe1"},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"MongoDB test 2","subtitle":"Canada mongoose 2","author":"hcm","body":"woah, dude.\nthere's, like, two of us.","labels":["test"],"index":11,"_id":"5b956601a784a405380a2fe2"},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Mongoose testing 3","subtitle":"MGT : revengeance","author":"hcm","body":"Woah, dude\nThree of us","labels":["test"],"index":12,"_id":"5b956d3851e92a086e465f7d"},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Mongoose testing 4","subtitle":"MGT : RE | revengeance","author":"hcm","body":"Woah, dude\nFOUR of us","labels":["test"],"index":13,"_id":"5b956d8924d83708e51ec7b2"},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Mongoose testing 5","subtitle":"MGT : reVengeance","author":"hcm","body":"Woah, dude\nROME of us","labels":["test"],"index":14,"_id":"5b956de8293dab092ae97baf"},{"date":"09/09/2018","subjects":["Testing"],"title":"Mongoose testing 6","subtitle":"MGT : Fa6 of the Furious","author":"hcm","body":"Woah, dude\nVIN of us","labels":["test"],"index":15,"_id":"5b956e190f692e0956adc2ed"}]}
